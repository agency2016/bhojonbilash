            <h2 class="">Brave New World Bhojonbilash.com.</h2>
            <p class="">Hi. We changed some things. Made some things different. Made a lot of things better.
                And now we’re going to tell you about those things. And answer questions.</p>
            <hr>
            <!-- questions -->
            <div class="faq_qna">
                <h4 class="question1 question"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus faq_icon" id="change_icon"></span><strong>Is this Bhojonbilash’s new site?</strong></h4>
                <p class="answer1 answer">Sort of. It’s an upgraded version of the GrubHub you’re used to. So, while the core functionality is nothing new, there are more than enough tweaks and new features built into to justify calling it “all new” or “sparkling” or whatever you want to call it.
                Also, it looks better. A lot better. Like our CEO after a haircut.</p>

                <h4 class="question2 question"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus faq_icon" id=""></span><strong>What happened to the old site?</strong></h4>
                <p class="answer2 answer">Uh… we replaced it with the new one? Why else would we have made a new one? It’s like what people do with iPhones or Corollas, you know? Upgrade and never look back.</p>

                <h4 class="question3 question"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus faq_icon" id=""></span><strong>Is the new GrubHub better? Or does it just look better?</strong></h4>
                <p class="answer3 answer">We’re upgrading plenty of things, and more features are coming soon. But, for now, yeah, it’s better – filters are improved, search got an overhaul, and we’re finally recommending things based on what people near you are in to.
                    And, hey, thanks for saying it looks better. We thought so, too.</p>
                <h4 class="question4 question"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus faq_icon" id=""></span><strong>I’m not logged in automatically. What gives?</strong></h4>
                <p class="answer4 answer">We upgraded our login, so you’ll have to re-sign in the first time you use the new site.If you forget any of your details, the “Forgot your password” button will get you all sorted out.</p>

                <h4 class="question5 question"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus faq_icon" id=""></span><strong>What happened to [feature ‘X’]?</strong></h4>
                <p class="answer5 answer">To be honest, we couldn’t do a redesign without moving a few things around and tweaking some features. Each change we made was based on user feedback and expectations, but if you have any questions or concerns about various features, please send them in Red Feedback widget on the right side of your screen.</p>

                <h4 class="question6 question"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus faq_icon" id=""></span><strong>What is Bhojonbilash?</strong></h4>
                <p class="answer6 answer">Maybe we should have answered this question first? Anyway, we let you order food online from a lot of restaurants in a lot of cities around America. Like, 900+ cities and tens of thousands of restaurants.
                    In short: if you want to order delivery or pickup, this is an easier way for you to do that from a huge variety of restaurants.</p>
